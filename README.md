# Bike-Share-Regression
predict the number of daily bike users.

# Background

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership,
rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from
a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing
programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great
interest in these systems due to their important role in  environmental and health issues.
Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being
generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services
such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these
systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing
mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via
monitoring these data.

#3 Objectives and Deliverables
1.   complete a regression analysis on the data, the goal is to predict the number of daily bike users.  Decide whether casual, registered or total
is most valuable as a dependent variable.
2.  Determine an interesting insight that would catch my attention.
3. Tell a story with the data.
